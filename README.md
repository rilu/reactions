Devopsreactions on Nancy and reveal.js using scriptcs.

Howto on a windows machine (until monosupport comes along for scriptcs):

install Chocolatey from  ```http://chocolatey.org/``` if you don't have it already.

run ```cinst git``` if you don't have git

run ```cinst scriptcs``` if you don't have scriptcs

run ```git clone https://github.com/rilu/reactions.git``` to some nice place on your harddrive

run ```cd [the place on your hardrive where the repository you just cloned resides]```

run ```scriptcs -install```

run ```scriptcs download.csx``` to download all posts from devopsreacations

run ```scriptcs start.csx``` as administrator

type  ```localhost:1337``` in your browser

enjoy!
